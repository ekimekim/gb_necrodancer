; "SB" Serial transfer data
; Once a transfer is initiated (either by writing to SerialControl or by the other device)
; the contents of this register get rotated out and transmitted, and the receiving bits rotated in, leftwise,
; one bit per cycle.
SerialData EQU $ff01
; "SC" Serial control
; Write bits 7 and 0 to initiate a transfer. Add bit 1 to use fast cycles (CGB only).
; Write bit 7 and it will stay set until a transfer initiated by the other device completes.

;   CGB in double speed mode: 2^14Hz (64/128 normal/double speed cycles)
;   Fast cycles: 2^18Hz (4 cycles)
;   Fast cycles in double speed mode: 2^19Hz (2/4 normal/double speed cycles)

; When it overflows (increments from $ff), a Timer interrupt fires.
; After overflowing, its value is set to the value at TimerModulo.

; "IF" Interrupt flag register. The hardware will set a bit in this register when an interrupt
; would be generated, even if interrupts are currently disabled. Bits respectively (from 0 to 5) refer to
; VBlank, LCDC, Timer, Serial and Joystick interrupts.
; May also be set manually to cancel a pending interrupt or manually fire one.
InterruptFlags EQU $ff0f

; $ff10 - $ff3f are sound registers:

; Channel 1 Sweep register. Controls frequency sweeps.
; Bits 0-2 control how much it changes each step. According to bgb docs, it changes by old freq / 2^n
; where n is this number 0-7. However, experiments with bgb show that no sweep occurs if n = 0.
; Bit 3 controls increasing (0) or decreasing (1) frequency.
; Bits 4-6 select sweep time, or 0 to disable sweep. bgb docs get confusing here but it seems
; roughly like step frequency = 128/n Hz where n is this number 1-7.

; Control of what generator channels should be routed to each output channel.
; For each nibble, bits 0-3 correspond to generator channels 1-4.
; Top nibble is left channel, bottom nibble is right channel.
SoundMux EQU $ff25

; Sound control. Read if individual channels are currently on or off for bits 0-3,
; sets all sound on/off for bit 7. You should set this to 0 on start to disable sound,
; as initial sound channel values are random.
SoundControl EQU $ff26

; "LCDC" LCD control register. Defaults to $91. Write to these bits to control the display mode:
; 0: DMG: Background off/on
;    CGB in compat mode: Background *and window* off/on
;    CGB: 0 disables priority bits of background and window tiles, sprites are always on top
; 1: Sprite display off/on

LCDControl EQU $ff40

; "STAT" LCD Status register. Its value changes as the LCD goes through draw cycles.
; It has 4 "modes". The current mode is indicated by the bits 0-1 as a 2 bit mode value:
; 00: During H-Blank
; 01: During V-Blank
; 10: While searching sprite ram. The CPU cannot access the sprite ram during this mode.
; 11: While transferring data. The CPU cannot access sprite ram or vram during this mode.
; You can also write to bits 2-6 to set the conditions under which a LCDC Interrupt should occur:
; bit 3: When mode becomes H-Blank
; bit 4: When mode becomes V-Blank (how is this different from vblank interrupt?)
; bit 5: When mode becomes Sprite search
; bit 6: When the LY register reaches a certain condition according to bit 2:
;        When bit 2 is 0: Trigger when LY != LYC
;        When bit 2 is 1: Trigger when LY == LYC
LCDStatus EQU $ff41

; "SCY" Scroll Y register. Controls scroll position of the background.
ScrollY EQU $ff42
; "SCX" Scroll X register. Controls scroll position of the background.
ScrollX EQU $ff43

; "LY" LCD Y-coordinate register. Contains the current y-coordinate that the screen
; is drawing. Contains values 0-143 while drawing, 144-153 during VBlank.
; Writing to this register will set it to 0.
; You should probably just never touch this unless you're doing something funky.
LCDYCoordiate EQU $ff44
; "LYC" LCD Y-coordinate comparison register. Is used when deciding whether to trigger an interrupt,
; see STAT register.
LCDYCompare EQU $ff45

; "DMA" Direct Memory Access Transfer control register.
; DMA transfer allows you to rapidly copy data from elsewhere in memory ($0000-$f19f) to the sprite memory
; area ($fe00-$fe9f). While this is happening, only high ram ($ff80-$fffe) can be used.
; DMA transfer is initiated by writing the upper byte of the start source address to this register.
; eg. to start the transfer from address $1200, you would write $12.
; The DMA will complete 448 cycles later, best calculated as 28 loops of {dec a; jr nz}
; Though another source reports 160 cycles?
DMATransfer EQU $ff46

; "BGP" Background and Window palette data
; All palette regs are monochrome mode only (not CGB) and map values 0-3 in pixel data
; to colors 0-3 from light to dark. Lowest 2 bits are for value 0, next 2 bits for value 1, etc.
; eg. to map 0-3 -> 0-3, use %11100100. To invert colors, use %00011011.
TileGridPalette EQU $ff47
; "OBP0", "OBP1" Sprite data palettes
SpritePalette0 EQU $ff48
SpritePalette1 EQU $ff49

; "WY", "WX" Window X and Y position.
; The window overwrites the background on the display, unlike sprites which are transparent.
; The actual on-screen coordinates of the window's top left are (WX-7, WY).
; If X or Y is set greater than 166 or 143 respectively, window will not show.
WindowY EQU $ff4a
WindowX EQU $ff4b

; CGB color palette registers
; The CGB has two dedicated 64-byte RAM sections for color palettes that is only accessible via the
; Background Palette Index/Data and Sprite Palette Index/Data registers respectively.
; Note that this data can only be accessed at times when VRAM may be accessed.
; A color value is a 16-bit little-endian value 0bbb bbgg gggr rrrr (ie. in memory gggrrrrr 0bbbbbgg).
; A single palette is 4 color values and maps tile values 00, 01, 10 and 11 to each color respectively.
; Each section contains 8 color palettes.
; The index register's bottom 6 bits selects an address in the RAM section. The top bit, if set,
; causes the index to be automatically incremented upon data write.
; Data is written/read to the specified address via the data register.
; The TileGrid palettes begin initialized to all white, but sprites are uninitialized.
TileGridPaletteIndex EQU $ff68
TileGridPaletteData EQU $ff69
SpritePaletteIndex EQU $ff6a
SpritePaletteData EQU $ff6b
; Finally, note that values are not perfect RGB values - (31,31,31) is a light grey, and intensities
; are not linear - 16-31 are all very bright, medium and dark colors are in the 0-15 range.
; Also, colors are mixed oddly - sometimes changing one value will also influence others.
; This completes changes on GBA emulating CGB! 0-15 are almost black.
; One source suggests GBA-specific palettes of (CGB-value)/2 + 16.

; "KEY1" Game Boy Color speed switch.
; Bit 7 is unset/set when in normal/double speed respectively.
; Bit 0 should be set to 1, then a STOP command issued to switch modes.
CGBSpeedSwitch EQU $ff4d

; "VBK" Game Boy Color VRAM Bank select
; Write to bit 0 of this register to pick between VRAM banks 0 and 1.
CGBVRAMBank EQU $ff4f

; CGB VRAM DMA transfer
; Copies from CGBDMASource to CGBDMADest.
; Source must be in ROM, SRAM or WRAM, and on a 16-byte boundary (bottom 4 bits are ignored).
; Dest must be in VRAM (top 3 bits are ignored), and on a 16-byte boundary (bottom 4 bits are ignored).
; The Control register's bottom 7 bits select the length in units of 16-byte blocks, - 1.
; eg. to transfer 256 bytes would be 256/16 - 1 = 15, and we can request lengths in the range from
; 16 to 2048 bytes.
; The top bit of the control register selects the transfer mode, which is one of:
; General Purpose DMA: The program is halted until the transfer is complete, and normal issues around
;   timing of VRAM writes apply. The final value of the Control register will be $ff.
; H-Blank DMA: One 16-byte block is transferred per H-Blank period. Execution is paused while this
;	occurs but otherwise proceeds as normal. You may not modify the src/dest registers or switch
;   banks being read from or written to.
;   During the transfer, Control register will contain the value (number of blocks left - 1),
;   or $ff when complete. The DMA may be aborted early by writing a 0 to the top bit of the control register.
;   In this case, the bottom bits hold an undefined value but the top bit will be 1.
;   Note this means that in all cases the top bit being 0 indicates an ongoing transfer, and 1 no transfer.
; In both modes, transfer of one block takes 2^-17s, which is 8 cycles in normal mode or 16 in fast mode.
; Some ROM carts may not support DMA due to not being able to handle the high speeds. There is no reliable
; way to check for this.
